% FIGURE 3.4 of SIMONS & WANG
%
% INPUT:
%
% method   'SE' by Slepian "extension" [faster!]
%          'GL' by direct Gauss-Legendre integration [slow!]
%          'RS' by direct Riemann summation [slow!]
%          'compare' by comparison of the methods
%
% Makes a fried-egg plot for +- angular orders for concentration to a
% disk-shaped domain. If 'method' is 'GL' The eigenvalues will be ever so
% slightly different from the "truth" that we know so well - they may not
% occur exactly in pairs, etc. But overall this is pretty well behaved to
% a part in a million or so starting from reasonable choice.

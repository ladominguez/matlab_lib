This matlab library was written to estimted the theoretical travel times
and the coefficients of reflection/refraction for local earthquakes in
the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca.

The function CreateInputFiles must be run when used for first time.

new_ttimes is an adaptation of the iaspei travel times (by R. Buland)
	to run this ptogram you need the files deltas.dat and
	EarthquakeParams.dat created by CreateInputFiles.m, and the 
	files iaspei.tbl iaspei.hed
